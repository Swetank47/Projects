The code takes in the sample images. 

It detects the type of houses which are represented as coloured triangles(blue houses having priority 2 and red houses having priority 1) ,burnt and unburnt areas on the bases of their colour and gives output of an image which clearly distinguishes between them .

It calculates the number of houses and the priority of houses(no_of_blue_houses*2 +no_of_red_houses) in burnt and unburnt areas.These values are printed with each image.

Priority ratio(priority of houses in burnt area/priority of image in unburnt area) is calculated for all images and then the the images are displayed in descending order of priority image.
